Step 1: Before the programming process, we make sure that the ESP32 board works
By programming the LED of the board with different frequencies
Step 2: Download the Arduino IDE (its environment)
Step 3: identify the ESP32 board by searching about it in the Boards manager and installing it
Step 4: select the board that we will work on (ESP32 Arduino - WEMOS D1 MINI ESP32)
Step 5:  download the BLINK code to make sure that the board works

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
}



Step 6: change the (delay)
