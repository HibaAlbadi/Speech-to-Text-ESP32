# Speech-to-Text-ESP32
First task:
Convert speech to text..(arabic languge)
This task will cover a speech-to-text. We will ask the user to speak something and we will use the SpeechRecognition object to convert the speech into text and then display the text on the screen by using javascript.
We used several methods and events to complete the process of converting speech to text:
* recognition.start() method is used to start the speech.
* the onstart event can be used to inform the user that speech recognition has started and they should speak into the mocrophone.
* the onresult event will have the result when the user is done speaking.
* recognition.stop() method is used to stop the speech.
* recognition.lang to define the language used


Second task:
ESP32 algorithm..
ESP32 is a Powerful Wi-Fi+Bluetooth/Bluetooth LE modules that target a wide variety of AIoT applications, ranging from low-power sensor networks to the most demanding tasks.
This task we will present a simplified algorithm for install the ESP32 board with useing Arduino IDE compiler
